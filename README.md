## Installation

The project is based of off python 2.7, but is best used with the `virtualenv` development scheme.

1. Install Python 2.7
2. Install virtualenv: `$ [sudo] pip install virtualenv`
3. Clone the github project: `$ git clone https://github.com/trilliumtransit/oba_rvtd_deployer.git`
4. Instantiate the virtual python environment for the project using python 2.7: 
  - Windows: `virtualenv --python=C:\Python27\python.exe oba_rvtd_deployer`
  - Linux: `virtualenv -p /path/to/python27 oba_rvtd_deployer`
5. Browse to project folder `cd oba_rvtd_deployer`
6. Activate the virtualenv: 
  - Windows: `.\Scripts\activate`
  - Linux: `bin/activate`
7. (Windows only) Manually install the `pycrypto` library.  The followin command assumes you have 32 bit python 2.7 installed: `pip install http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/pycrypto-2.6.1/pycrypto-2.6.1-cp27-none-win32.whl`  If 64 bit python 2.7 is installed, run the following command instaed:  `pip install http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/pycrypto-2.6.1/pycrypto-2.6.1-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl`
8. Install the python project using develop mode: `python setup.py develop`

## EC2 Setup

You will need to do the following for automatically launching Amazon EC2 instances using the scripts:

- Create AWS account
 - Get the access key
 - Get the secret access key
- Create security group
 - Add your IP to list of allowed inbound traffic [(see aws docs)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html).
- Create key pair [(see aws docs)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html).
 - Download .pem file to computer
- (Windows only) instally PuTTY and PuTTYgen
 - [Download from here](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).
 - Create .ppk file [(see aws docs)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html).

## Config Files

You'll need to create a bunch of config files before running the deployment scripts.  Run the script `setup_config` to be prompted for each setting, or create a new folder called `config` and add the files manually.  All config files are .ini files and have a single section called 'DEFAULT'.

## Running Scripts

If using linux, the executable files to run scripts will be in the `bin` folder instead of `Scripts`.  In the remainder of the docs, whenever it says "run script `script_name`", you'll run the script by doing `bin/script_name` or `.\Scripts\script_name` on linux and windows respectively.

| Script Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| clean_config | Deletes the "config" folder. |
| setup_config | Helper script to create configuration files for AWS, OneBusAway and updating and validating GTFS. |
| launch_new_ec2 | Launches a new Amazon EC2 instance and installs the essential software to run OneBusAway.  User will be prompted to manually disable IPv6 and setup PostgreSQL. |
| tear_down_ec2 | Terminates an Amazon EC2 instance. |
| install_oba | Installs OneBusAway on server by compiling with maven. |
| validate_gtfs | Downloads and validates the static GTFS. |
| update_gtfs | Creates a new data bundle for OneBusAway. Validate the GTFS if no GTFS file found. |
| deploy_oba | Deploys the OneBusAway webapps to Tomcat. |
| start_oba | Starts Tomcat and xWiki Servers. |
| stop_oba | Stops Tomcat and xWiki Servers. |
| deploy_master | Combines following scripts in order: launch_new_ec2, install_oba, update_gtfs, deploy_oba, start_oba.  Be sure to manually setup OneBusAway and xWiki after the server is ready. |

## Watchdog Setup

Just before the master deployment script finishes, it will install OneBusAway Watchdog on the instance.  If you haven't configured the watchdog.ini file, the script will help you build the config file.  Also, you'll need to copy over the check_oba.py script to the config folder and change the path to the watchdog config file on the instance.  Usually this should be `/home/ec2-user/config/watchdog.ini`.  To see a full list of config params, see [this list](https://github.com/djstroky/onebusaway-watchdog-rvtd#setup).

## OneBusAway Setup

After installing OneBusAway, the webapp will need to be configured manually.  Get the public dns name of the instance and add to the url so you get `ec2-###-###-###-###.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/onebusaway-webapp`.  Upon starting, you'll be prompted to add an admin account.

## xWiki Setup

After installing and starting xWiki for the first time, it will be blank.  It is best to import a backup to have all needed pages.  Follow these steps to import the backup:

1.  Download a backup from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1ueEUCcTtKoYjF0X2g3S05nOXM/view?usp=sharing).
2.  Remote onto machine.
3.  Stop xWiki server using command `sudo /usr/local/xwiki/stop_xwiki.sh -p 8081`.
4.  Edit the file `/usr/local/xwiki/webapps/xwiki/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg`.
5.  Uncomment the line `xwiki.superadminpassword=PASSWORD`.
6.  Start xWiki server using command `sudo nohup /usr/local/xwiki/start_xwiki.sh -p 8081 > /dev/null &`.
7.  Open browser and go to `ec2-###-###-###-###.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8081`.
8.  Login using username `superadmin` and the password you defined.
9.  Browse to import tool.  Click on `Home` > `Administer Wiki`.   Then click `Content`.  Then click `Import`.
10.  Upload file (the backup file you downloaded in step 1).
11.  Select the file and select option `Replace the document history with the history from the package`.  Then click `Import`.
12.  Stop xWiki server using command `sudo /usr/local/xwiki/stop_xwiki.sh -p 8081`.
13.  Edit the file `/usr/local/xwiki/webapps/xwiki/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg` and comment out the superadmin line.
14.  Start xWiki server using command `sudo nohup /usr/local/xwiki/start_xwiki.sh -p 8081 > /dev/null &`.
